# Sensor Data Collection

This repository provides starter code for collecting and storing sensor data with Arduino boards and Python scripts.  
It is designed to be beginner-friendly for users without a computer science background.

## Folder Structure

- **PPGcollect/**  
  Includes Arduino code and Python script for collecting **PPG (Photoplethysmography)** sensor data.  
  See the detailed [PPG Collection Tutorial](./PPGcollect/PPG%20Collection%20Tutorial.md).

- **IMUcollect/**  
  Contains Arduino and Python code for collecting **Acceleration & Gyroscope (IMU)** sensor data.
## Notes

- Please file an issue if you need more code for other sensors or if you require **sensitivity changes**.  
- The code is tested primarily with Arduino Uno, Nano, and Nano 33 BLE. Other boards can be supported with small modifications.
- New sensor data collection will be updated here as the project grows
